Manage User-Contributed Online Magazines with Wordpress. This plugin allows you to accept submissions and then accept them as contributions to a magazine issue, flag them for later review, or reject them.

Install as normal for WordPress plugins.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

 = How do I allow users to register and contribute =

 You must allow user registration in Settings > General and (after plugin activation) set the default user type to "Submitter". Alternatively you can use <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/tags/user-registration">another plugin</a> to make user registration more user-friendly.
